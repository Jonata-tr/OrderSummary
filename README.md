## My process
  
### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

I took the opportunity to study about flex and grid, they are very similar to each other, so I was very confused with "Which one should be used in this part? Did I use the right one?", but during the duration of this small project, I learned a lot about grid and flex, and the best situations for each of them.
